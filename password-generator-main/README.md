# Password Generator [![GitHub Latest Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Antyss77/password-generator?logo=github)](https://github.com/Antyss77/password-generator/releases)   <img alt="GitHub issues" src="https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Antyss77/password-generator"> <img alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/741862512307339264"> 

 This project aims to provide a secure solution for creating strong and unique passwords.
